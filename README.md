# Volatility-Regime-Detection-in-Stock-Returns
This project implements a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to identify and analyze latent market volatility regimes—Low Volatility Bull, Low Volatility Sideways, and High Volatility Stress—using financial time series data. The model captures regime transitions, durations, and probabilistic state dynamics for market behavior analysis.
