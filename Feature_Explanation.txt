Log Retruns: -
It measures how much the index price changed from one day to the next, in relative terms.

Intuition: -
Positive → market went up
Negative → market went down
Near zero → market was stable

Volatality is defined as variation in returns, not prices


Absolute Returns: -
The magnitude of price movement, ignoring direction.

Big market moves up or down -> Large Absolute returns
clam markets -> Small Absolute returns

High-volatility markets are characterized by large price swings, regardless of gain or loss.

This helps clustering distinguish:
Calm days
Shock days

Absolute returns capture the intensity of market movements, which is essential for identifying turbulent periods


7-Day Rolling Volatality: -

Standard deviation of returns over the last 7 trading days.
Captures short-term risk
Sensitive to sudden shocks
Reacts quickly to news/events

Sudden market stress
Short-lived volatility spikes

Short-term rolling volatility helps detect sudden regime shifts and market shocks.


14-Day Rolling Volatility: -

Volatility measured over two trading weeks.
Smooths out daily noise
Captures medium-term risk trends
Markets don’t switch regimes instantly; this feature captures transition behavior.

Medium-term volatility reflects sustained market uncertainty rather than daily noise


30-Day Rolling Volatility: -

Volatility over approximately one trading month.
Represents long-term market risk
Stable indicator of market regime
Separates structural high-risk periods (e.g., crises)
Less sensitive to daily fluctuations

Long-term rolling volatility captures structural changes in market risk.


Volume Change: -

Day-to-day percentage change in trading volume.
High volume → strong market participation
Sudden volume spikes → panic or excitement

High volatility + high volume → panic
High volatility + low volume → low liquidity

Volume change provides additional context on market participation during different volatility regimes


I engineered return-based and rolling volatility features across multiple time horizons to capture both short-term shocks and long-term risk regimes, which are critical for understanding market behavior.
